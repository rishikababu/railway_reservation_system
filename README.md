# railway_reservation_system
A simple railway ticket booking system built using Flask. This project allows users to search trains, check seat availability, book tickets, and cancel bookings with automatic refund logic.  Note: This is an academic/demo project and does not include payment processing. All booking and refund actions are simulated for demonstration purposes.
